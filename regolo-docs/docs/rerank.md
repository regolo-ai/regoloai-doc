# Rerank

The **Rerank** API lets you re‑order a list of documents (or passages) according to their relevance to a given query.  
It is powered by models such as **`Qwen3‑Reranker‑4B`** and returns the top‑N most relevant documents together with a relevance score.

**When to use it** – After you have retrieved a large set of candidate documents (e.g., with BM25, vector search, or another LLM), feed them to the Rerank endpoint to obtain a concise, high‑quality ranking that can be directly presented to users or passed to a downstream LLM for answer generation.

## API Call Parameters

!!! tip

    **Important note** – The endpoint expects a **JSON** payload and the total request size (including all documents) must stay lighter as possible. If you have many candidates, consider chunking them and calling the API multiple times.

| Parameter   | Type                           | Description |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
| **model**   | `string` (required)            | Identifier of the reranker model, e.g., `Qwen3‑Reranker‑4B`. |
| **query**   | `string` (required)            | The user’s question or search query. |
| **documents** | `array[string]` (required)   | List of candidate documents/passages to be reranked. |
| **top_n**   | `integer` (optional) | Number of highest‑scoring documents to return. |
